# Unity-Zelion
idk what i am doing for now

following [this guy's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@MisterTaftCreates/playlists)

done : 
- ep 1 to 4 of tloz in unity series
- basic animations
- quick & dirty dash implementation
- tilemaps ( dirty )

issues : 
- able to get inside colisions, and to get stuck (due to player going too fast and having a small collisionbox ? )
- camera smoothness: the player and camera going in the same direction make a jittery/stuttery effect
- cloning the repo does not clone all unity settings, etc. need to find a way to make these settings reproducible
- after dashing, the player cannot move for half a sec

todo : 
- tilemaps 
- interfaces (player, ennemies, items)
- ui 
- custom sprites
- network :skull:
