# Unity-Zelion
idk what i am doing for now

had been following [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/@MisterTaftCreates/playlists)'s' tutorials at the begining of the project,
now doing most things without following a series


### working :
- basic movements
- sword
- arrows
- poison bomb ( but can't damage at a fixed time )

### wip
- poison bomb
- new sprites
- AI
- UI : healthbar

### todo:
- network
- UI : menus
- time-related capacities

### network
to implement it, it think we should make 1 to 3 inactive players, that become active when someone joins the game.

### mabye
- interpolation if some calculations are slowing the game too much
